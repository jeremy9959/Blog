The paper [Mosiac Copy Number Variation in Human Neurons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975283/)
describes a CNV pipeline in its [supplementary materials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975283/bin/NIHMS561969-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf).  They use 500kb "dynamically sized genomic windows containing 500kb of uniquely mappable DNA sequence, as defined by the *wgEncodeCrgMapabilityAlign40mer* track from the UCSC Genome Browser."

In his blog, [Dave Tang](https://davetang.org/) discusses these tracks in several posts:

- [ENCODE mapability and repeats](https://davetang.org/muse/2013/07/08/encode-mappability/)
- [Genome mapability](https://davetang.org/muse/2012/09/14/genome-mapability/)
