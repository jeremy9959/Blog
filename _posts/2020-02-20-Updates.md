## Where am I?

This blog has been quiet for a while now but there are still things happening,
they're just reported in other places.

### bokeh

I've done some work on [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org).  In particular:

- a simulation of [Polya's Urn](http://polyas-urn.herokuapp.com)
- code that creates the structure graph of a bokeh model and [draws it using bokeh](https://gist.github.com/jeremy9959/984e2c09182a8ab0da692d04ab6c2e8a)
- a [theme builder](http://bokehthemebuilder.herokuapp.com) (work in progress) for bokeh

### Notes for ML

As part of my Spring project course on machine learning I've written some notes on fundamental things:

- [Bias and Variance](http://jeremy9959.net/Math-5800-Spring-2020/notebooks/BiasVariance.html)
- [Polynomial Regression](http://jeremy9959.net/Math-5800-Spring-2020/notebooks/PolynomialRegression.html)
- [Curse of Dimensionality](http://jeremy9959.net/Math-5800-Spring-2020/notebooks/CurseOfDimensionality.html)
- [Precision, Recall, and ROC](http://jeremy9959.net/Math-5800-Spring-2020/notebooks/PrecisionRecall.html)
- [Principal Components](http://jeremy9959.net/Math-5800-Spring-2020/notebooks/PCA.html)
